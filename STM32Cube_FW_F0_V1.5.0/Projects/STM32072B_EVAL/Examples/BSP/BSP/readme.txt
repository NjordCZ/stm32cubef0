@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the different BSP drivers. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 48 MHz.

This example shows how to use the different functionalities of LCD, SD card, 
eeprom, temperatue sensor and joystick by switching 
between all tests using tamper button. 

 ** Push the User button to start first Test.  
Blue Led (LD4) will blink between each test. Press tamper button to start another test:

 ** JOSTICK **
Use the joystick button to move a pointer inside a rectangle 
(up/down/right/left) and change the pointer color(select).

 ** LCD **
This example shows how to use the different LCD features to display string
with different fonts, to display different shapes and to draw a bitmap.

 ** SD **
This example shows how to erase, write and read the SD card and also 
how to detect the presence of the card.

 ** EEPROM **
This example show how to read and write data in EEPROM I2C M24LR64 connected on STM32072B-EVAL
   * The I2C RF EEPROM memory (M24LR64) is available thru the connector CN2.

 ** TSENSOR **
This example show how to read a Temperature using the temperature sensor.


 ** CEC **
This example shows how to initialize and detect the devices connected on the HDMI-CEC 
according the device type choosen. It displays the received messages. The board can be configured as 
ROOT or not and with the use of HDMI-DDC or not.

@note Connect HDMI cable to HDMI_SOURCE and with another device which support HDMI connection.

</!\ Be careful : HDMI-CEC has same I2C address than RF EEPROM ANT7-M24LR-A /!\>

 ** LCD LOG **
This example show how to use the LCD log features.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F072VB devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32072B-EVAL RevB board
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
